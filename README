3.2.3 Compile Linux Kernel
Download Linux Kernel Source Code:

$ git clone https://github.com/friendlyarm/linux.git -b sunxi-4.14.y --depth 1
Compile and Update Linux Kernel:

$ cd linux
$ touch .scmversion
$ make sunxi_arm64_defconfig ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
$ make Image dtbs ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
If your compilation is successful an Image will be generated under "arch/arm64/boot/" and a dtb file will be generated under "arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/".

If your SD card's boot partition is mounted at "/media/SD/boot/" you can update its Image and dtb files by running the following commands:

$ cp arch/arm64/boot/Image /media/SD/boot/
$ cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun50i-h5-nanopi*.dtb /media/SD/boot/
Compile and Update Modules:

$ cd linux
$ make modules ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
If your SD card's rootfs partition is mounted at "/media/SD/rootfs/" you can update its modules by running the following commands:

$ cd linux
$ make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/SD/rootfs/ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
